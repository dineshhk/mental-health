			<b style = "font-family: Segoe UI; font-size:150%; text-align:left; color:white;"><u><i>#INTRO</b></u></i>
			<pre style = "font-family: Segoe UI; font-size:130%; text-align:left; color:white;">
			Many people diagnosed with mental illness achieve strength and recovery through participating in individual or group treatment. 
			There are many different treatment options available. There is no treatment that works for everyone – individuals can chose the 
			treatment, or combination of treatments, that works best.
			</pre>
	
			<b style = "font-family: Segoe UI; font-size:150%; text-align:left; color:white;"><u><i>#PSYCOTHERAPY</b></u></i>
			<pre style = "font-family: Segoe UI; font-size:130%; text-align:left; color:white;">
			Psychotherapy is the therapeutic treatment of mental illness provided by a trained mental health professional. Psychotherapy 
			explores thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and seeks to improve an individual’s well-being. Psychotherapy paired with medication 
			is the most effective way to promote recovery. Examples include: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Exposure Therapy, Dialectical 
			Behavior Therapy, etc.
			</pre>
			
			<b style = "font-family: Segoe UI; font-size:150%; text-align:left; color:white;"><u><i>#MEDICATION</b></u></i>
			<pre style = "font-family: Segoe UI; font-size:130%; text-align:left; color:white;">
			Medication does not outright cure mental illness. However, it may help with the management of symptoms. Medication paired 
			with psychotherapy is the most effective way to promote recovery.
			</pre>
			
			<b style = "font-family: Segoe UI; font-size:150%; text-align:left; color:white;"><u><i>#CASE MANAGEMENT</b></u></i>
			<pre style = "font-family: Segoe UI; font-size:130%; text-align:left; color:white;">
			Case management coordinates services for an individual with the help of a case manager. A case manager can help assess, 
			plan, and implement a number of strategies to facilitate recovery.
			</pre>
			
			<b style = "font-family: Segoe UI; font-size:150%; text-align:left; color:white;"><u><i>#HOSPITALIZATION</b></u></i>
			<pre style = "font-family: Segoe UI; font-size:130%; text-align:left; color:white;">
			In a minority of cases, hospitalization may be necessary so that an individual can be closely monitored, accurately diagnosed or 
			have medications adjusted when his or her mental illness temporarily worsens.
			</pre>
			
			<b style = "font-family: Segoe UI; font-size:150%; text-align:left; color:white;"><u><i>#SUPPORT GROUP</b></u></i>
			<pre style = "font-family: Segoe UI; font-size:130%; text-align:left; color:white;">
			A support group is a group meeting where members guide each other towards the shared goal of recovery. Support groups are often 
			comprised of nonprofessionals, but peers that have suffered from similar experiences.
			</pre>
			
			<b style = "font-family: Segoe UI; font-size:150%; text-align:left; color:white;"><u><i>#COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE</b></u></i>
			<pre style = "font-family: Segoe UI; font-size:130%; text-align:left; color:white;">
			Complementary & Alternative Medicine, or CAM, refers to treatment and practices that are not typically associated with standard care. 
			CAM may be used in place of or addition to standard health practices.
			</pre>
			
			<b style = "font-family: Segoe UI; font-size:150%; text-align:left; color:white;"><u><i>#SELF HELP PLAN</b></u></i>
			<pre style = "font-family: Segoe UI; font-size:130%; text-align:left; color:white;">
			A self-help plan is a unique health plan where an individual addresses his or her condition by implementing strategies that promote wellness. 
			Self-help plans may involve addressing wellness, recovery, triggers or warning signs.
			</pre>
			
			<b style = "font-family: Segoe UI; font-size:150%; text-align:left; color:white;"><u><i>#PEER SUPPORT</b></u></i>
			<pre style = "font-family: Segoe UI; font-size:130%; text-align:left; color:white;">
